üñºÔ∏è REAL VS. AI-GENERATED IMAGE TEXTURES: A MACHINE LEARNING STUDY

This repository contains our project on distinguishing real images from AI-generated images using texture-based features and a variety of machine learning models. The work compares multiple classifiers and explores dimensionality reduction techniques to optimize performance.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

PROBLEM: 
The increasing realism of generative models like GANs and diffusion networks makes manual detection of AI images nearly impossible.

HYPOTHESIS: 
AI-generated images contains non-human textural artifacts that are not present in authentic photographs.

OBJECTIVE: 
To evaluate if machine learning classifiers can effectively distinguish Real vs. AI images using a feature set derived from texture analysis.

üßæ DATASET:

Source: Kaggle Dataset: Real vs AI-Generated Image Texture Feature Dataset

1. Size: 66,898 rows √ó 123 columns

2. Distribution:  33,477 Real images

3. 33,421 AI-generated images

4. Features: 122 float features + 1 label column


üìä RESULTS & KEY INSIGHTS:

1. Feature Selection:

Random Forest performed best ‚Üí 81% accuracy.

2. Feature Extraction (PCA):

SVM (RBF kernel) performed best ‚Üí 80.75% accuracy.

3. Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, and KNN showed moderate performance compared to Random Forest and SVM.

üéØ CONCLUSION

1. This study confirms that an image's textural properties are a strong indicator of its origin, making it an effective method for detecting AI-generated content.

2. Our findings show that dimensionality can be significantly reduced through both PCA and feature selection without a major loss in performance.

3. For this specific task, Random Forest and the RBF kernel SVM proved to be the most accurate and reliable classifiers.
